Here is TREAT #3!

<p> <img src="https://ashleemarie.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/homemade-churros.jpg" alt = "Churros" title="You can find these standing in line at Six Flags" width="500" height="350" align="right"/> <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> This weekend I got a churro from Cinnabon. I was so excited because it's some new thing they're trying to do. However, it had some weird apple pie filling, it was cold, and I won't be ordering that again. </p>
